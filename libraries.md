# Libraries used by HackPSU's rfid device
These libraries are to be downloaded from their original creator and placed into the lib directory as necessary.  The lib directory is in our .gitignore to avoid licnesing problems

## Arduino Library
We are using the Arduino default library for NodeMCU
### Arduino Scheduler
The Arduino Scheduler library is a standard Arduino library that requires separate installation, so that will need to be added via the Arduino SDK prior to compilation.

## RFID Library
We are using [miguelbalboa](https://github.com/miguelbalboa)'s [rfid library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) for NXP's MFRC522.<br/>
This library can be installed by downloading the repository as a .zip file and installing it in the Arduino IDE.
